                        What are piano juries?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1"> 
                        Every year, piano majors have to take a weekly piano technique class, taught by a grad student. Each week, you will need to play a few exercises in front of your peers, after which you'll receive some advice on what to fix and how to improve from your graduate instructor.
                        <br><br>
                        The document linked below tells you when you'll have to take the piano technique class, as well as what you have to prepare for the technique jury at the end of each quarter of technique class.
                        <br><br>
                        It also explains what you'll have to play for your performance juries, as well as when they are. Make sure to read it carefully so you don't miss anything!
                        <br><br>

                    <h2>
                        How do I sign up for juries?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        A week or so before each jury, the Piano Department will post a sign-up sheet on the bulletin board all the way at the end of the 4th floor RCMA hallway. Make sure to check your email often for the announcement (usually during the week before the jury date)! Snagging a good jury time for you can help prevent time conflicts and stress from exams, which will be happening around the same time.
                        <br><br>
                        
                    </p1>
                    <h2>
                        What should I do on the days of my technique and performance juries?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Technique juries are very informal. Each grad student has different preferences on how they will test their students (for example, my 2021-22 technique juries were less than 5 minutes of scale-technic exercises, and we just filmed ourselves in the practice rooms using our phones and sent in the videos thru email).
                        <br><br>
                        Performance juries, on the other hand, are similar to final exams for performance majors. Make sure to dress appropriately! Overdressed is better than underdressed- show up in what you'd normally wear to perform in a recital or concert. 
                        <br><br>
                        You don't need to bring sheet music to your performance jury, but right after you bow for the jury judges (the Piano Department professors), you'll need to announce what you'll be playing, so make sure to memorize the name of your piece! (I'm talkin' composer, opus, key, etc.) 
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, piano performance juries take place in Galvin. Get there 10 minutes before your scheduled jury time and wait backstage until the person before you comes offstage (the entrance to backstage is a set of double doors around the side of Galvin, on the right side of the big windows facing the lake in the lobby).
