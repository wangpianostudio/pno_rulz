                        How do I schedule a recital?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1"> 
                        Recitals in Bienen are 100% self-planned (of course, you can ask friends for help organizing it, but initiating the event and sorting out big details are all up to you). 
                        <br><br>
                        First, set a date and location for your recital (and make sure to clear it with Dr. Wang first!). You can go to this link: <a href="https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/northwestern#!/home/dash" id="linkdoc"> Northwestern Room and Events System </a> to find out which halls are available at what time. Type in "BSM" in the location search bar to find a list of all Bienen halls you can reserve! You can find more information on how to sign up for rehearsal spaces and concert venues here: <a href="https://music.northwestern.edu/resources/students/venue-access" id="linkdoc"> https://music.northwestern.edu/resources/students/venue-access</a> .
                        <br><br>
                        IMPORTANT: The most challenging time to plan a recital is at the second half of spring quarter (because of all the senior recitals happening around then), so if you can help it, try to schedule your recital earlier in the year!
                    </p1>
                    <h2>
                        I don't have a recital requirement this year, but I want to hold one anyways! What do I do?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1"> 
                        Don't tell anyone outside of the studio, but you can actually schedule a recital off-the-books in your first or second year!
                        <br><br>
                        Follow the above steps for scheduling a recital (go to 25live.collegenet.com), but when you're requesting the hall, instead of saying that it's a recital, tell them it's a "recording"! This isn't a lie, because you technically will be recording your recital. 
                        <br><br>
                        * NOTE: because the Concert Management Office doesn't know it's actually a recital, you'll have to ask friends to help you set up and staff your recital (i.e. a friend to help press "record" on your phone when you start playing, a friend to help arrange your refreshments table), because the Office won't be supplying you with Concerts at Bienen staff.

                        Recital Checklist

                    <p1 class="p1">
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Reserve a room. If you're splitting the recital with a friend (this is called a joint recital; it's a useful tactic because preparing an entire recital's worth of rep by yourself is A LOT of work), you can reserve a max of 2 hours/day each for a total of 4 hours. Make sure you have AT LEAST half an hour prior to the start of the recital so that you have lots of time to set up and warm up.</li><br>
                            <li>
                                Plan a complete dress rehearsal in the venue that you'll be playing in. If you plan on live-streaming, you can test your sound and microphone system during this time. (Also, ask a pianist friend to sit in on your dress rehearsal and let you know what effect the hall's acoustics has on your playing. You will need to adjust your pedal and touch accordingly.)
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Make sure to design and print out recital programmes. Check with Dr. Wang for the proper way to format a recital program; there's specific guidelines that are important to follow! (The Concerts at Bienen Office will print out programs for degree recitals, but if you're not holding a degree recital/you want nicer quality programs you'll have to DIY.)
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                If you'd like to have a reception, make sure to buy supplies ahead of time. You'll likely need: 1) a tablecloth, 2) utensils/napkins/cups/plates, 3) soda/juice/water, 4) cookies/some kind of easy-to-eat snack. It's a good idea to put the nonperishable things in your Bienen locker a couple days before the recital; that way, when recital day comes, you won't have to lug everything all the way from the store or from your dorm, which will save you time and valuable energy.
                                <br><br>
                                It's important to note that there's foldable tables in the vending machine area near McClintock that you can use for your post-performance reception! The custodial staff are happy to assist if you ask nicely, since the tables are very heavy.

                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Yes. Wanglings need to support each other no matter what. It's an act of courtesy and respect.
                        <br><br> 
                        Write down all your studio mates' recital dates/times the moment you learn about them and make sure your schedule is clear to attend. (You can also check the Performance Calendar tab on this website if you need.)
