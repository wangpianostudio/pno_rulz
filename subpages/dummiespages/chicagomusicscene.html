                        How can I watch big names like Trifonov and Barenboim perform live for $15?

                        The CSO has a student discount! You can buy tickets online on their website. Just enter the code "STUDENT" before you pick your seats and you'll be able to watch some of the biggest artists in classical music for the price of 3 cups of coffee!
                        <br><br>
                        However, student ticket pricing usually doesn't become available until a month or a few weeks before the performance, so make sure you check the website regularly in the weeks leading up to the performance so you can snag the seats with the best view and acoustics as soon as they're available under student prices!

                    <h2>
                        Tips for Going to the CSO
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        The CSO has a really cool gift shop that's worth paying a visit! (I got a nice piano-pattern lanyard there for about 7 dollars, and they have loads of fun music-patterned socks and other knicknacks.)                
                        <br><br>
                        Never go to the CSO alone. Ideally, find 3-4 other friends to go with. CSO concerts usually end late at night, and you NEVER want to be in Chicago alone at night, especially now that, post-COVID, the streets of Chicago are even more dangerous than they used to be. Don't worry, though- if you're in a large group, it's pretty safe!
                        <br><br>
                        Sign up for the CSO's email and mailing list! They'll send you previews of who they've got scheduled for each season and you can plan way in advance (that way, you'll never miss out on your favorite pianists).
                    </p1>
                    <h2>
                        How do I watch world-class musicians just a 10 minute walk from my dorm?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Check the Concerts at Bienen event schedule calendar! Often, they'll invite amazing guest artists from around the world (note: look up the Skyline Piano Artist Series).
                        <br><br> 
                        Plus, your non-pianist musician friends have performances every quarter that are 1000% worth going to! All the large and small ensembles at Bienen are incredible and it's fun to cheer on your friends on.
