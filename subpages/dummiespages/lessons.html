                        How do I sign up for lessons?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Every quarter, Dr. Wang will hang a sign-up sheet on her office door, located on 4th floor RCMA (you can find her room number on the directory by the 4th floor elevator doors). Once you get there, pick a time from the available spots and write your name and phone # to claim it. If the only spots that fit your schedule are taken, you can contact the people who've claimed it via their phone #s and ask to trade.
                    </p1>
                    <h2>
                        What should I bring to my lesson?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Dr. Wang allows her lessons to be recorded. It's a great idea to invest in a small handheld recorder (for example, I use the TASCAM DR-40 Linear PCM Recorder) and record your lessons onto an SD card so you can revisit the lesson later if needed.
                        <br><br>
                        You ideally should have about 3 excerpts of music prepared for class: 1) a piece that you are, technique-wise, very confident in, which only needs to be polished, 2) a piece that you're in the earlier stages of learning but you still know notes and dynamics fairly well, and 3) a very recently learned piece.
                        <br><br>
                        Always bring 2 copies of what you'll be playing to lessons. If you don't use physical copies of music (hallo, iPad users), you need to send Dr. Wang a <em>compressed</em> PDF of your music AT LEAST a day in advance to give her adequate time to download it onto her iPad before the lesson. (*This is important because, sometimes, her email doesn't properly refresh on her iPad and you'll spend your valuable lesson time waiting on an easily preventable tech issue.) You can also AirDrop the <em>compressed</em> file on the day of.

                    <h2>
                        What should I do right before my lesson?
                    </h2>
                    <p1 class="p1">
                        Try to schedule an hour of free time right before your lesson so that you have time to get to Bienen, warm-up, prepare yourself mentally, snack (if needed), and take a bathroom break. It may sound silly, but these small things will help maximize the productivity of your lesson.
                        <br><br>
                        Arrive to your lesson 5 minutes in advance. (You can wait outside Dr. W's door, but there's also a sitting area at the end of the hallway if you prefer.) When it's time for your lesson, Dr. Wang will let you in.
                        </p1>
